  <strong>Hi, I'm John Paul Moran</strong> <i>AKA ArtworkJPM</i>. In 2006 I started working full time as a Mac Artworker in the print industry. After learning all about creating and amending artwork I decided to progress into web design. After attending several college courses, online courses, I landed an internship as a junior web designer. In 2013 I started working full time in Web design and finally started getting paid!

  <strong>What is my ideal job?</strong>
  <br> I love working with HTML, CSS, JS and I love to learn new things. I am currently working in the travel industry and would like to carry on in this industry - however if a job came up to work for an interesting company in a different industry I'd be interested. I love creating graphics and working in a team.
