<p>When I first bought my cheap Ridgeback Velocity hybrid bike from Evans in Clerkenwell, London, back in 2006, I had no idea it was the beginning of love affair that would develop into a long term happy marriage.</p>

<p>My plan was to buy a bike to get around London quicker, mostly on the weekends as I was living centrally and could walk to work. There had been a slow burning trend towards cycling in London, in some parts due to the tragic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_July_2005_London_bombings" target="_blank">7/7 events in 2005.</a> Bike sales that summer shot up after the incident for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="italics">
  <li>Tubes and Buses were down for at least two weeks</li>
  <li>People were worried they would be murdered!</li>
</ol>  
  <p>Friends I knew in London told me it was insane to see so many cyclists around that summer (I was working on-board a cruise ship as a Photographer in the Mediterranean when 7/7 happened). </p>

<p>The London Transport system soon reopened and the mass cycling started to diminish, by the winter time is was virtually back to normal.</p>

<p>However there was an undercurrent of a cycling craze. After I bought my bike, I had to wait a day for them get it ready. I spent a lot of money on accessories, it was crazy. I needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A lock</li>
  <li>Lights</li>
  <li>Mudguards</li>
  <li>Helmet</li>
  <li>Gloves</li>
  <li>Mini tools</li>
  <li>Pump</li>
  <li>Puncture repair kit</li>
  <li>And so on.....</li>
</ul>

<p>What was a cheap bike ended up being quite pricey. Anyway the next day the bike was ready, I saw it shining in the shop, noticeably taller than other bikes because I'm 6'5. I took the bike outside, hopped on and off I went. And then.....wow.....</p>
<p>Suddenly I am on the road with cars, buses, motorbikes, I hadn't driven a car for years and suddenly I am classed as a vehicle. I have to stop at red lights and indicate by using my arms - I could have an accident! However suddenly I am in Holborn Circus - <b> within 1 minute!</b></p>
<p>I carry on and the next minute I'm in St Pauls. Cycling is fast, way faster than buses and taxis, plus I'm reliving my childhood!</p>
<p>It doesn't take long to cycle to Liverpool Street, I turn right and head to Shoreditch, stopping at Hoxton Square to catch my breath and to calm the adrenaline that is pumping in my body. I can see some hipsters drinking and smoking outside a nice looking bar.</p><p>Its spring time around 6pm, there is still plenty of sunlight. I am outside, getting exercise on a vehicle faster than cars in a bustling city - <b>I am already hooked on cycling</b></p>
