<p class="overflow-hidden">I started learning HTML back in 2007 when I made a my own website and some small business websites. Since <b>HMTL5</b> came out its been a revelation to use more semantic html, built in form validation and post media content more easily. </p>

<p class="overflow-hidden">It took me a while to get my head around using CSS, however through projects I learnt it's beauty. CSS3 offers more options like text-shadow, border-radius, flex-box, calculating sizes.</p>

  <li><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> - this is the course I highly recommend!</li>

<p class="overflow-hidden">I understand how responsive design works, through media queries or flex-box. I've created my own media queries and used frameworks like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>  to assist me.</p>

<p class="overflow-hidden">I still have more to learn. I have used PHP to create forms that post emails and of course I use it in Wordpress. </p>
